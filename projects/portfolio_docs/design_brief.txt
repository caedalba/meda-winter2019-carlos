Angel Falls- Venezuela

One of the best experiences in my life, it is famous for being one of the four most beautiful waterfalls in the world, and as the tallest uninterrupted waterfalls in the world, the place is full of natural wealth;  surrounded by rivers, flora, fauna, jungles, mountains and tepuyes;  The landscape is surreal.  To get to the place you must go canoeing for 5 hours and walk two more hours, Katherine's company made it seem like a short time.

The falls got their name from Angel Falls after an American aviator became the first person to fly over the falls in the mid-20th century.

It is an easy trip to organize, I recommend you check the following links if you decide to visit this beautiful place:
